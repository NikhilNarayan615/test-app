Here's a brief explanation of the design and technical choices made for the prototype:

A) Design Choices:

1. User Experience Focus: The design prioritizes a seamless and intuitive user experience to ensure ease of navigation and interaction within the designated section.
2. Visual Consistency: Consistent use of design elements, colors, typography, and spacing from the Aceternity UI framework creates a cohesive and professional appearance.
3. Responsive Design: The prototype is responsive, ensuring that it adapts gracefully to various screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.
4. Clarity and Readability: Emphasis is placed on clear communication and readability of content, ensuring that information is presented in a concise and easy-to-understand manner.

B) Technical Choices:

1. React with Next.js: Next.js is chosen as the framework for building the prototype due to its robust features such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and easy deployment capabilities. These features contribute to improved performance and SEO optimization.
2. Aceternity UI Framework: The Aceternity UI framework is utilized for its comprehensive set of pre-designed UI components and styles, which accelerate development and ensure consistency in design across the application.
3. Component-Based Architecture: The prototype is built using a component-based architecture, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. Each UI element is encapsulated within a React component, enabling easy composition and customization.
4. Deployment on Vercel: The prototype is deployed on Vercel for hosting, leveraging their seamless deployment workflows, scalability, and reliability. This allows for quick iteration and sharing of the prototype with stakeholders for feedback.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
